# Markus_Dress_Nettside
Project 1 of websides I want to create using pure html, css and javascript.
Everything will be in english for easier use of names of elemnts and styles, but the content will be in norwegian. 
This webpage will be an improvement for this website; https://christianiaskredder.no/katalog/dress-og-vest
I'm going to use the website as a mock up as well as my refferance.
This is going to be a mobile first website.
